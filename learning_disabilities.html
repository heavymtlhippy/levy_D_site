            <h2 id ="whatIs">What is a Learning Disability?</h2>
            <p>Formally, the <b>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</b> defines a specific learning disability as “a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations.” </p>
            
            <p>However, as IDEA’s definition notes, “Specific Learning Disability does not include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; of intellectual disability; of emotional disturbance; or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.” This clause helps to distinguish learning disabilities from the other disability categories specified by IDEA. <b>Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)</b> is by far the largest category of disability within the Individuals for Disabilities Education Act.  Nearly half of all disabled children are labeled in the category of SLD. </p>
            
            <p>Simply put, learning disabilities, or learning disorders, are an umbrella term for a wide variety of learning problems. A learning disability is <strong>not</strong> a problem with intelligence or motivation. Kids with learning disabilities aren’t lazy or dumb. In fact, most are just as smart as everyone else. Their brains are simply wired differently. This difference affects how they receive and process information.</p>
            
            <p>Children and adults with learning disabilities see, hear, and understand things differently. This can lead to trouble with learning new information and skills, and putting them to use. The most common types of learning disabilities involve problems with reading, writing, math, reasoning, listening, and speaking. The most important thing to remember is: <span class = "emphasize">children with learning disabilities can and do succeed!</span></p>

            <dt><b>Dyslexia: Learning disabilities in reading </b></dt>
            <dd>There are two types of basic types of learning disabilities in reading. Basic reading problems occur when there is difficulty understanding the relationship between sounds, letters and words. Reading comprehension problems occur when there is an inability to grasp the meaning of words, phrases, and paragraphs. </dd>
            
            <p>Signs of reading difficulty include problems with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>letter and word recognition</li>
                <li>understanding words and ideas</li>
                <li>reading speed and fluency</li>
            </ul>
