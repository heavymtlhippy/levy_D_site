            <h2 id ="whatIs">What is a Learning Disability?</h2>
            <p>Formally, the <b>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</b> defines a specific learning disability as “a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations.” </p>
            
            <p>However, as IDEA’s definition notes, “Specific Learning Disability does not include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; of intellectual disability; of emotional disturbance; or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.” This clause helps to distinguish learning disabilities from the other disability categories specified by IDEA. <b>Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)</b> is by far the largest category of disability within the Individuals for Disabilities Education Act.  Nearly half of all disabled children are labeled in the category of SLD. </p>
            
            <p>Simply put, learning disabilities, or learning disorders, are an umbrella term for a wide variety of learning problems. A learning disability is <strong>not</strong> a problem with intelligence or motivation. Kids with learning disabilities aren’t lazy or dumb. In fact, most are just as smart as everyone else. Their brains are simply wired differently. This difference affects how they receive and process information.</p>
            
            <p>Children and adults with learning disabilities see, hear, and understand things differently. This can lead to trouble with learning new information and skills, and putting them to use. The most common types of learning disabilities typically fall into one of two general categories: &ldquo;input&rdquo; disorders and &ldquo;output&rdquo; disorders.  Input disorders indicate a problem with receiving information whereas output disorders indicate a problem with relaying information. The most important thing to remember is: <span class = "emphasize">children with learning disabilities can and do succeed!</span></p>
            <h2 id ="Types">Common Types of Disabilities</h2>
            
            <dt id="Dyslexia"><b>Dyslexia: Learning disabilities in reading </b></dt>
            <dd>There are two types of basic types of learning disabilities in reading. Basic reading problems occur when there is difficulty understanding the relationship between sounds, letters and words. Reading comprehension problems occur when there is an inability to grasp the meaning of words, phrases, and paragraphs. 
            
            <p>Signs of reading difficulty include problems with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>letter and word recognition</li>
                <li>understanding words and ideas</li>
                <li>reading speed and fluency</li>
                <li>general vocabulary skills</li>
            </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt id="Dyscalculia"><b>Dyscalculia: Learning disabilities in mathematical reasoning</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Learning disabilities in math vary greatly depending on the child’s other strengths and weaknesses. A child’s ability to do math will be affected differently by a language learning disability, than it will be by a visual disorder or a difficulty with sequencing, memory or organization.</p>
            
                <p>A child with a math-based learning disorder may struggle with memorization and organization of numbers, operation signs, and number “facts” (like 5+5=10 or 5x5=25). Children with math learning disorders might also have trouble with counting principles (such as counting by twos or counting by fives) or have difficulty telling time.</p></dd>
                
            <dt id="Dysgraphia"><b>Dysgraphia: Learning Disabilities in writing skills</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Learning disabilities in writing can involve the physical act of writing or the mental activity of comprehending and synthesizing information. <em>Basic</em> writing disorder refers to physical difficulty forming words and letters. <em>Expressive</em> writing disability indicates a struggle to organize thoughts on paper.</p>
                <p>Symptoms of a written language learning disability revolve around the act of writing. They include problems with</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>neatness and consistency of writing</li>
                    <li>accurately copying letters and words</li>
                    <li>spelling consistency</li>
                    <li>writing organization and coherence</li>
                </ul></dd>
            <dt id="Dysphasia"><b>Dysphasia and Aphasia: Learning disabilities in language skills </b></dt>
            <dd><p>Language and communication learning disabilities involve the ability to understand or produce spoken language. Language is also considered an <em>output</em> activity because it requires organizing thoughts in the brain and calling upon the right words to verbally explain something or communicate with someone else.</p>
            
            <p>Signs of a language-based learning disorder involve problems with verbal language skills, such as the ability to retell a story and the fluency of speech, as well as the ability to understand the meaning of words, parts of speech, directions, etc.
            </p></dd>
            
            <dt id="Dyspraxia"><b>Dyspraxia: Learning disabilities in motor skills</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Motor difficulty refers to problems with movement and coordination whether it is with fine motor skills (cutting, writing) or gross motor skills (running, jumping). A motor disability is sometimes referred to as an <em>output</em> activity because it relates to the output of information from the brain. In order to run, jump, write or cut something, the brain must be able to communicate with the necessary limbs to complete the action.</p>
            <p>Signs that your child might have a motor coordination disability include problems with physical abilities that require hand-eye coordination, like holding a pencil or buttoning a shirt.</p></dd>
            
            <h2 id="eyes">Auditory and Visual Processing Problems</h2>
           <p>The eyes and the ears are the primary means of delivering information to the brain, a process sometimes called &ldquo;input.&rdquo; If either the eyes or the ears aren’t working properly, learning can suffer.</p>
            <dt><b>Auditory Processing Disorder</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Professionals may refer to the ability to hear well as “auditory processing skills” or “receptive language.” The ability to hear things correctly greatly impacts the ability to read, write and spell. An inability to distinguish subtle differences in sound, or hearing sounds at the wrong speed make it difficult to sound out words and understand the basic concepts of reading and writing.</p></dd>
            
            <dt><b>Visual Processing Disorder</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Problems in visual perception include missing subtle differences in shapes, reversing letters or numbers, skipping words, skipping lines, misperceiving depth or distance, or having problems with eye–hand coordination. Professionals may refer to the work of the eyes as “visual processing.” Visual perception can affect gross and fine motor skills, reading comprehension, and math.</p></dd>
            
            <h2 id="Others">Other Disorders (not disabilities)</h2>
            <p>Difficulty in school doesn’t always stem from a learning disability. Anxiety, depression, stressful events, emotional trauma, and other conditions affecting concentration make learning more of a challenge. In addition, ADHD and autism sometimes co-occur or are confused with learning disabilities.</p>
            <dt><b>ADHD</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), while not considered a learning disability, can certainly disrupt learning. Children with ADHD often have problems sitting still, staying focused, following instructions, staying organized, and completing homework.</p></dd>
            
            <dt><b>Autism Spectrum Disorders</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Difficulty mastering certain academic skills can stem from pervasive developmental disorders such as autism and Asperger’s syndrome. Children with autism spectrum disorders may have trouble communicating, reading body language, learning basic skills, making friends, and making eye contact.</p>
            <p>While these are not technically learning disability disorders, they can certainly make the input and output processing of information more challenging.  If you suspect that your child may have an Autism Spectrum Disorder, contact a professional to get a diagnosis as soon as possible.</p></dd>
