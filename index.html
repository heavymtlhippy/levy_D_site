           <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <strong>Dori Levy, <em>M.Ed</em></strong>
            <br><em> Learning Consultant</em>
                      
                      
       <h3> What is a Learning Consultant?</h3>
        <p>&#8195; Simply put, a Learning Consultant is a person who acts as an expert resource for special needs students (and their parents), obtaining the necessary information about students and their individual circumstances, communicating students' specifc needs to school personnel appropriately, and overall helping those students and parents to navigate the educational system as it pertains to Special Education. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What exactly does a Learning Consultant do?</h3>
        <p>&#8195; The answer is: a lot of things!  Learning Consultants are there to help parents understand and advocate for the special needs of their children. This can mean taking on several different roles in the special education process from providing monitoring/testing/assessment services to maintaining communication with professionals who serve the students outside of school, aiding in the development of specific education plans, to providing professional development for faculty regarding general and special needs issues.  For specifics on what Dori Levy can do to help you, check out the provided services page. </p>
        <h3>Why do I need a Learning Consultant?</h3>
        <p>Parents need to know what is within their rights and how to find research-based instructional strategies that work. It can be challenging to navigate all aspects of the IEP process while also handling all of the responsibilities that come with being the parent of a special needs child.  For this reason alone, parents need a professional who is on their side.  </p>
        <h3>Why choose Dori Levy?</h3>
        <p>Dori uses considerable experience of over 45 years in the NJ educational system as a Special Education teacher and administrator to help parents understand how to interact in IEP or 504 planning meetings, how to advocate for their child, and what they should know about their parental rights.  If you are a parent who is feeling overwhelmed  by the special education process, you need the kind of help that Dori is here to provide.</p>
